## Overview :
  *Firstly, we created a server.js file and initialize it.Secondly, we installed express and cors frameworks, the first one is to ease creating apps and saves a lot of coding time, and the second one is to make the server open for all client requests .Thirdly, we started building the server.js file by specifying a port number for it then sending requests and receiving responses. Finally, we let our server start working*
